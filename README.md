# tv-vibehack

> **Custom build (this fork).** Based on [Gathin23/tv-vibehack](https://github.com/Gathin23/tv-vibehack) (MIT), with the launcher customized:
> 5-icon frosted-glass dock with long-press drag-to-reorder that stays put, 12 built-in wallpapers switchable from the top bar (with an optional slow-drift animation), the wallpaper button next to the network pill, a network icon that follows the connection type, no app-tinted background colors, and a UI that follows the system language (English / 中文 / Bahasa Indonesia).
> The ready-to-install APK is attached to the [latest release](https://github.com/Mayvin168/tv-vibehack/releases/latest).

**Your TV, minus the ads.** Debloat any Android TV / Google TV over ADB and give it a clean,
tvOS-inspired launcher. Hand the prompt to Claude Code or any coding assistant, answer a few
questions about which apps you use, and it does the rest on the real TV.

Everything is reversible: packages are disabled, never uninstalled, and a restore script puts the
stock launcher back.

## Quick start

1. On the TV: Settings → Device Preferences → About → press OK on **Build** seven times → back →
   Developer options → turn on **USB debugging** (and Network/ADB debugging if your TV shows it).
   Keep the TV on and on the same Wi-Fi as your computer.
2. Open Claude Code (or your assistant of choice) on your computer and paste the prompt from
   [`PROMPT.md`](PROMPT.md), filling in your TV model.
3. Accept the "Allow USB debugging?" prompt on the TV when told to, then answer the checklist
   questions (which apps you use, which four go in the dock).

That's it. The assistant backs up, debloats, builds and installs the launcher, and verifies each
step with screenshots from the TV. If you'd rather do it by hand, the pieces are below.

## What's in the repo

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| [`PROMPT.md`](PROMPT.md) | The prompt. Brand-neutral; the assistant discovers your TV's bloat. |
| [`launcher/`](launcher/) | The tvOS-style launcher. Edit `app/src/main/res/values/config.xml` for your dock, hidden apps and Live TV package, then run `build-and-install.sh`. |
| [`tools/tv.py`](tools/tv.py) | Pure-Python ADB client (shell, batch, push, pull). Works where the stock `adb` is blocked. |
| [`tools/b64push.py`](tools/b64push.py) | Uploads larger files (APKs) as base64 chunks with an md5 check. |
| [`tools/disable.sh`](tools/disable.sh), [`tools/restore.sh`](tools/restore.sh) | Apply or undo a debloat list. |
| [`examples/`](examples/) | Per-TV debloat lists. Add yours, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). |

## The launcher

A small native Android TV home screen (`com.gathin.tvhome`), built for sets with 1 GB of RAM:

- Pitch-black background, like Apple TV 4K.
- A dock at the bottom in a lighter rounded band with the four apps you choose. The shelf above
  shows the focused dock app's name in large type with an ambient glow sampled from its banner.
  Press Down and the dock slides up to reveal the rest of your apps in a grid.
- One translucent glass highlight springs from tile to tile. The focused tile lifts and shows its
  name.
- Frosted pills top right: **Inputs** (a dropdown of HDMI ports, AV and Live TV), **Wi-Fi**
  (shows the network name) and **Settings**. Greeting, a large thin clock and the date top left,
  set in [Outfit](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Outfit).
- Deterministic D-pad navigation, last focused tile remembered, staggered entrance animation.
  No blur, no video, no network, no background services.

Configure it in [`launcher/app/src/main/res/values/config.xml`](launcher/app/src/main/res/values/config.xml):
dock order, hidden apps, Live TV package and columns. Build and install with

```bash
TV_HOST=192.168.1.50 launcher/build-and-install.sh
```

Needs JDK 17 and the Android SDK (platform 34, build-tools 34.0.0). On macOS:
`brew install openjdk@17 android-commandlinetools && sdkmanager "platforms;android-34" "build-tools;34.0.0"`.

## Talking to the TV by hand

```bash
python3 -m venv tools/venv && tools/venv/bin/pip install -r tools/requirements.txt
export TV_HOST=192.168.1.50                                   # your TV's IP
tools/venv/bin/python -I tools/tv.py --probe                 # model, Android version, firmware
tools/venv/bin/python -I tools/tv.py 'pm list packages'      # one command
printf 'cmd1\ncmd2\n' | tools/venv/bin/python -I tools/tv.py --batch
tools/disable.sh examples/xiaomi-mi-tv-4a/debloat.txt        # apply a list
tools/restore.sh examples/xiaomi-mi-tv-4a/debloat.txt        # undo it, restore stock launcher
```

### Gotchas we hit

- **macOS: `adb connect` says "No route to host"** while the port is clearly open. Recent macOS
  treats the Google-signed `adb` as its own app under Local Network privacy and silently blocks it.
  `tools/tv.py` avoids the binary entirely.
- **No "wireless debugging" toggle** on some TVs (Xiaomi among them). USB debugging alone opens
  network ADB on port 5555.
- **Chained `pm` commands** (`pm disable a; pm disable b`) may silently stop after the first. Run
  one per shell call; `--batch` does this.
- **Large pushes hang** through the Python client. Use `tools/b64push.py` for APKs.
- **Disable the stock launcher only after the new one is installed**, or the Home button lands on
  a factory test app.
- **Third-party launchers** often charge for basics like a custom wallpaper. Hence `launcher/`.
- **No on-screen keyboard** after switching launchers (seen on Xiaomi): the default input method
  pointed at a Baidu IME that isn't installed. Fix with
  `tools/tv.py 'ime set com.google.android.inputmethod.latin/com.android.inputmethod.latin.LatinIME'`.

## Supported TVs

Anything running Android TV or Google TV: Xiaomi/Redmi, TCL, Hisense, Sony, OnePlus, Realme,
Nvidia Shield and most others. Not Samsung Tizen, LG webOS or Amazon Fire TV (different OS, no ADB
launcher replacement). Tested so far on the models in [`examples/`](examples/).
